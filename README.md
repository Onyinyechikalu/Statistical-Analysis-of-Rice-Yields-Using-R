# Statistical-Analysis-of-Rice-Yields-Using-R
This project investigates whether the mean grain yield for a rice variety (R1) in experimental fields differs significantly from the literature value of 3.5 t/ha. Using statistical hypothesis testing, the analysis determines if fertilizer treatment or field conditions significantly increased the yield.
